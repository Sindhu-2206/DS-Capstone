#Hands-On (3/13) Visualization for LLM and Generative AI Applications
Deliverables for Submission

#LLM & Transformer Visualization
Objective: Showcase attention weights, embedding spaces, or other visualizations explaining LLM/Transformer model behavior and interpretability.
What to Include

Attention visualization: transformer heads, focus on specific tokens
Embedding space visualization: sentence/document embeddings (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP projections)
Example use cases: sentiment classification, question answering, retrieval tasks
Recommended Tools

Matplotlib / Seaborn for heatmaps
Plotly for interactive embedding spaces
Hugging Face Transformers Visualization tools
TensorBoard for attention and embedding layers

#Generative AI Workflow Diagram
Objective: Provide a clear diagram explaining the workflow or architecture of your Generative AI system: RAG, LoRA, or Stable Diffusion.
What to Include

RAG: retriever, retriever index (FAISS/Pinecone), generator (e.g., T5, GPT-3), document embeddings
LoRA: base model, inserted adapter layers, fine-tuned layers, task-specific adaptation
Stable Diffusion: text encoder (CLIP), latent space, UNet denoiser, image output
Data flow between components
Recommended Tools

Draw.io / diagrams.net
Lucidchart (EDU license available)
Figma
Graphviz for automated workflow diagrams

#Application Interface (UI/UX) Wireframe or Demo
Objective: Design wireframes or simple prototypes demonstrating how users will interact with your AI system.
What to Include

Chat interface for LLM responses
Document upload and retrieval interface (RAG)
Image generation input and output screens (Stable Diffusion)
Results display and user actions (e.g., submit prompt, upload data, receive outputs)
Recommended Tools

Figma
Balsamiq (low-fidelity prototyping)
Excalidraw
Adobe XD (high-fidelity prototypes)
Gradio (working demos of apps)
Streamlit
