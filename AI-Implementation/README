# AI-Implementation
Applying AI Techniques to the Project

Applying AI techniques meaningfully to the project. Below are examples of techniques that are applied. 

# AutoGPT and AI Agents Using LangChain:
Multi-agent systems for collaboration between AI models
Retrieval-augmented generation to enhance responses with external data
Memory persistence using vector databases to retain conversational context

Example: Implementing a LangChain-based agent that fetches and summarizes information
Code: Using LangChain with OpenAI API, FAISS memory, and SerpAPI for web search

# Speech and Audio Processing with Whisper
Speech-to-text conversion using deep learning models
Noise reduction and data preprocessing for improved accuracy
Summarization techniques to extract key insights from transcribed audio

Example: Running OpenAI Whisper to transcribe speech and process audio
Code: Using Whisper for transcription, improving accuracy with preprocessing
Each team must execute at least two of these notebooks and customize it to fit their project requirements.
