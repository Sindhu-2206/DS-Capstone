# Week 7:Hands-On (Week 7): RAG and AI Model Optimization for Deployment

# Topic 1: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for AI Applications

Objective: Introduce RAG techniques to enhance AI models with external knowledge retrieval, improving AI-generated responses, decision support, and explainability.

Key Concepts to Cover:

Introduction to RAG:
What is RAG, and why is it useful?
How does it improve AI applications by integrating dynamic knowledge retrieval?
Differences between RAG and standard LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude).
Retrieval Models & Vector Databases
Using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity-based document retrieval.
Setting up ChromaDB for scalable document indexing.
Using LangChain with GPT-4 or LLaMA for AI-powered contextual responses.
Hands-on Implementation

Build a Simple RAG Pipeline
Install required libraries: faiss, chromadb, langchain, openai (or use LLaMA).
Create embeddings using SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Implement FAISS-based document retrieval (storing medical/exercise/logistics texts for AI-based Q&A).
Integrate LLMs (GPT-4/Gemini/LLaMA) for knowledge-enhanced responses.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) will enhance AI applications by integrating real-world knowledge sources for more personalized recommendations.
PoseRight:
Retrieve exercise-specific guidance and generate AI-enhanced posture recommendations.
Incorporate sports science and rehabilitation best practices to improve posture correction techniques.
Pull data from fitness and physiotherapy literature to recommend optimized workout routines.
Fall Detection:
Retrieve medical guidelines for fall risk assessment from clinical research and elderly care recommendations.
Include best practices for elderly mobility assistance to reduce injury risks.
Access historical case studies on fall prevention and rehabilitation.
Chain Vision:
Retrieve real-time supply chain trends from external reports and industry forecasts.
Enhance logistics AI by integrating live tracking data, market demand analysis, and fuel efficiency trends.
Use AI to optimize warehouse stocking based on real-time consumer behavior and market fluctuations.
Travel AI (WanderCoders):
Retrieve destination-specific travel insights to recommend optimized travel plans.
Integrate real-time weather, flight availability, and local tourism data for dynamic itinerary adjustments.
Provide personalized recommendations based on travel purpose (business, leisure, adventure) using AI-powered planning.
Dieting & Grocery Tracking AI:
Retrieve nutrition-based insights to recommend health-conscious grocery shopping and meal planning.
Use dietary guidelines and medical sources to personalize meal plans for different health conditions (e.g., diabetes, weight loss, muscle gain).
Integrate real-time food availability and pricing trends to recommend cost-effective and healthy grocery options.
By integrating RAG, these applications will provide domain-specific, personalized recommendations, improving user experiences and decision-making across multiple sectors.

Deliverable: A basic RAG pipeline that integrates FAISS, LLMs, and real-world document retrieval.
# Topic 2: Optimizing Real-Time Processing for Web Applications
